<p><b>Misconceptions</b><br>
Cookies are not spyware or viruses and they can't read information from a computer. Neither are cookies the source for pop-ups or spam. They cannot be executed as code and are therefore incapable of transmitting computer viruses.</p><br>
<p><b>What is a cookie and why are they used by Get Safe Online?</b><br>
<br>Cookies are small files of letters or numbers downloaded on to a device when users access websites. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide service information to the owners of the site. Cookies can be grouped into three categories: "session", "persistent" and "first and third party".<br>

<br><i>Session cookies (Temporary)</i><br>
These are temporary cookie files, which are erased when you close your browser. When you restart your website browser and go back to the site that created the cookie, the website will not recognise you.<br>

<br><i>Persistent cookies (Permanent)</i><br>
These files stay in one of your website browser's subfolders until you delete them manually or your browser deletes them based on the duration period contained within the persistent cookie's file.<br>

<br><i>First and Third Party cookies</i>
Whether a cookie is 'first' or 'third' party refers to the website or domain placing the cookie. First party cookies are cookies set by a website visited by the user. Third-party cookies are created by a website other than the one you are currently visiting; for example, the Google analytics cookies placed on this website are third party which measure how many website visitors we receive.</p><br>
